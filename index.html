                An interdisciplenary researcher working with swarm systems @ Boston University.

            <p>
                I have a passion for understanding how systems work, especially those containing many interacting and interdependent parts.
                Through my research, I rigorously interrogate complex systems using tools from control theory, optimization, and nonlinear systems.
                These emergent behaviors allow swarm systems to accomplish tasks that are impossible for any single individual.
                My research emphasizes the <b>collective motion</b> of swarms, such as <b>flocking</b>, <b>formation control</b>, <b>task assignment</b>, and <b>predator avoidance</b>.

                I am interested in designing decentralized agent behaviors for complex systems such that we can extract useful performance guarantees on the emergent system-level dynamics.
                I work at the interface of control theory, co

                
                I take a full-stack approach to reseearch; starting with theoretical guarantees, validating through simulation, following through to hardware implementation.
                Considering the full spectrum of solutions leads to novel insights that any individual approach may not capture.
                My research is at the interface of control theory, complex systems, and optimization.
                I am interested in designing decentralized agent behaviors such that we can extract performance guarantees on the emergent system-level dynamics.
                This empowers us to make useful abstractions of these complex systems, rigorously examine their behavior, and analyze their dynamics at multiple scales.
                I have found applications in cyber-physical (e.g., robotic and transportation) as well as virtual (e.g., digital twins and video games) for this research.
                The former is critical to advancing the frontier of multi-robot and robotic swarm systems; the latter advances our understanding of distributed algorithms, multi-level abstractions, and human-centric design.
